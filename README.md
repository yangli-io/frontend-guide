# Frontend Guide
An opinionated guide to standard frontend web development

## Framework
Use **React**! React is one of the most popular frameworks out there for any type of web applications. It is maintained by developers from Facebook and Facebook is using it in production for many of their core apps. React also provides React Native which makes it easy for React developers to build mobile apps. React provides a strong community of developers along with libraries for almost anything you need. React is not a complete framework, it strives to focus on UI components and does UI components really well. Aside from React, Vue and Angular are also strong contenders.

**Vue** is not tied with any company and is thus able to innovate without the restrictions of one company. Vue is the most popular framework in China. Vue's philosophy is take the best of everything and put it in Vue. Vue is a great alternative to React incase you get bored of React. Vue is a complete framework in the sense that it tries to provide most of what you need inside one framework.

**Angular** is maintained by developers at Google. With a strong backing from Google and the constant innovation, Angular is pretty awesome and nice to work with. Angular is also a complete framework and tries to provide most of what you need.

When deciding which framework you want to use, focus on productivity not performance (unless your application is performance critical - e.g building photoshop on the web). Try to see if you can find the core libraries you need that are related to your framework and see if they are well maintained. There are various other frameworks which are very interesting and fun to play around with, such as Svelte, Yew and etc.

## Language

Use **Typescript**! Typescript is just awesome, full stop.

Javascript is still very useful to learn and sometimes you may not want to setup typescript for a small project.

## Unit Testing

Jest

## End to End Testing

Cypress
